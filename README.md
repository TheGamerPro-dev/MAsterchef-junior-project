# Masterchef-junior-project
This is a class project.
My favorite recpie to make is some typing soup:
Process:
1: Open any rich text editor.
2: Type to your content, and do not care about the words which come into your mind.
3: Serve, by saving the file, and ruining the space on your computer storage.
